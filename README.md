🚀 Building a Flight Price Prediction Model and Integrating it with Flask! ✈️

Excited to share my latest project on flight price prediction using machine learning, combined with a Flask web application for real-time predictions! This model predicts flight prices by analyzing key factors like airline, travel date, duration, stops, and more. Here’s an overview:

🔍 Data Preprocessing: Used techniques such as imputation, standard scaling, and one-hot encoding to prepare the data. Extracted specific features like day, month, and time to capture seasonal and time-based trends.

📊 Model Selection: Experimented with several algorithms (Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest, XGBoost) to find the best fit. Assessed models using metrics and learning curves to achieve high accuracy.

💻 Web App Integration: Saved the trained model and integrated it into a Flask application, creating a seamless web-based interface. Now, users can simply enter flight details and get an instant price prediction.

This project provided hands-on experience with data transformation, model training, and web deployment, bringing machine learning closer to practical use!
